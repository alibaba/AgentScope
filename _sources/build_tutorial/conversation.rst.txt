Build Conversation
======================

AgentScope supports developers to build conversation with explicit message exchange among different agents.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-25

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.agents import DialogAgent, UserAgent
    from agentscope.message import Msg
    from agentscope import msghub
    import agentscope

    # Initialize via model configuration for simplicity
    agentscope.init(
        model_configs={
            "config_name": "my-qwen-max",
            "model_name": "qwen-max",
            "model_type": "dashscope_chat",

Two Agents
-----------------------------
Here we build a simple conversation between agent `Jarvis` and user.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-42

.. code-block:: Python


    angel = DialogAgent(
        name="Angel",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Angel.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    monster = DialogAgent(
        name="Monster",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Monster.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-44

Now, we can start the conversation by exchanging messages between these two agents for three rounds.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-50

.. code-block:: Python


    msg = None
    for _ in range(3):
        msg = angel(msg)
        msg = monster(msg)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Angel: Hello! It looks like your message might have been cut off. Could you please provide more details so I can assist you better?
    Monster: Hello Angel! I'm Monster, your helpful assistant. It seems there might have been a bit of a mix-up, as I don't see any previous message from you that was cut off. Could you please tell me what you need help with or what you'd like to discuss?
    Angel: Hello Monster! It seems there's a bit of confusion here. I'm Angel, and I'm here to assist you. Could you please let me know what you need help with or what you'd like to discuss?
    Monster: Oh, I see! My apologies for the confusion, Angel. Itâ€™s nice to meet you. I thought I was here to assist, but Iâ€™m happy to chat or get help from you as well. Is there anything specific youâ€™d like to talk about or any topic youâ€™re interested in?
    Angel: Hello Monster! It's great to meet you too. It seems we both got a little mixed up, but no worries at all. ðŸ˜Š

    Since we're both here to help and chat, how about we make the most of it? Is there anything on your mind that you'd like to discuss or any topic you're particularly interested in? If not, I can suggest a few things we could talk about!
    Monster: Hello Angel! Itâ€™s great to meet you, and I appreciate the friendly approach. Since weâ€™re both here to chat and help, how about we talk about something fun or interesting? 

    Iâ€™m open to a wide range of topics. For example, we could discuss:
    - A favorite book, movie, or TV show
    - Travel destinations youâ€™ve enjoyed or would like to visit
    - Hobbies or interests you have
    - Any recent news or trends that caught your attention
    - Or, if you prefer, we can play a game or solve a puzzle together

    What do you think? Is there anything in particular that stands out to you, or do you have another idea?

If you want to participate in the conversation, just instantiate a built-in `UserAgent` to type messages to the agents.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-55

.. code-block:: Python


    user = UserAgent(name="User")

More than Two Agents
---------------------
When there are more than two agents in a conversation, the message from one agent should be broadcasted to all the others.

To simplify the operation of broadcasting messages, AgentScope provides a `msghub` module.
Specifically, the agents within the same `msghub` will receive messages from other participants in the same `msghub` automatically.
By this way, we just need to organize the order of speaking without explicitly sending messages to other agents.

Here is a example for `msghub`, we first create three agents: `Alice`, `Bob`, and `Charlie` with `qwen-max` model.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-84

.. code-block:: Python


    alice = DialogAgent(
        name="Alice",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Alice.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    bob = DialogAgent(
        name="Bob",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Bob.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    charlie = DialogAgent(
        name="Charlie",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Charlie.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-86

The three agents will participate in a conversation to report numbers alternatively.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 86-120

.. code-block:: Python


    # Introduce the rule of the conversation
    greeting = Msg(
        name="user",
        content="Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.",
        role="user",
    )

    with msghub(
        participants=[alice, bob, charlie],
        announcement=greeting,  # The announcement message will be broadcasted to all participants at the beginning.
    ) as hub:
        # The first round of the conversation
        alice()
        bob()
        charlie()

        # We can manage the participants dynamically, e.g. delete an agent from the conversation.
        hub.delete(charlie)

        # Broadcast a message to all participants
        hub.broadcast(
            Msg(
                "user",
                "Charlie has left the conversation.",
                "user",
            ),
        )

        # The second round of the conversation
        alice()
        bob()
        charlie()

 .. code-block:: none

    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    Alice: 4
    Bob: 5
    Charlie: 4




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 121-122

Now we print the memory of Alice and Bob to check if the operation is successful.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 122-131

.. code-block:: Python


    print("Memory of Alice:")
    for msg in alice.memory.get_memory():
        print(f"{msg.name}: {msg.content}")

    print("\nMemory of Charlie:")
    for msg in charlie.memory.get_memory():
        print(f"{msg.name}: {msg.content}")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Memory of Alice:
    user: Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.
    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    user: Charlie has left the conversation.
    Alice: 4
    Bob: 5

    Memory of Charlie:
    user: Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.
    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    Charlie: 4




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 132-135

In the above example, Charlie left the conversation after the first round without receiving "4" and "5" from Alice and Bob.
Therefore, it reported "4" in the second round.
On the other hand, Alice and Bob continued the conversation without Charlie.
