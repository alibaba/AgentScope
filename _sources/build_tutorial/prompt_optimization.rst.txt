System Prompt Optimization
============================

AgentScope implements a module for optimizing Agent System Prompts.

.. _system-prompt-generator:

System Prompt Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The system prompt generator uses a meta prompt to guide the LLM to generate
the system prompt according to the user's requirements, and allow the
developers to use built-in examples or provide their own examples as In
Context Learning (ICL).

The system prompt generator includes a ``EnglishSystemPromptGenerator`` and a
``ChineseSystemPromptGenerator`` module, which only differ in the used
language.

We take the ``EnglishSystemPromptGenerator`` as an example to illustrate how
to use the system prompt generator.

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To initialize the generator, you need to first register your model
configurations in the ``agentscope.init`` function.

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.prompt import EnglishSystemPromptGenerator
    import agentscope

    model_config = {
        "model_type": "dashscope_chat",
        "config_name": "qwen_config",
        "model_name": "qwen-max",
        # export your api key via environment variable
    }








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-47

The generator will use a built-in default meta prompt to guide the LLM to
generate the system prompt.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-58

.. code-block:: Python



    agentscope.init(
        model_configs=model_config,
    )

    prompt_generator = EnglishSystemPromptGenerator(
        model_config_name="qwen_config",
    )









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-70

Users are welcome to freely try different optimization methods. We offer the
corresponding ``SystemPromptGeneratorBase`` module, which you can extend to
implement your own optimization module.

Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Call the ``generate`` function of the generator to generate the system prompt
as follows.

You can input a requirement, or your system prompt to be optimized.

Generation with In Context Learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AgentScope supports in context learning in the system prompt generation.

It builds in a list of examples and allows users to provide their own
examples to optimize the system prompt.

To use examples, AgentScope provides the following parameters:

- ``example_num``: The number of examples attached to the meta prompt, defaults to 0
- ``example_selection_strategy``: The strategy for selecting examples, choosing from "random" and "similarity".
- ``example_list``: A list of examples, where each example must be a dictionary with keys "user_prompt" and "opt_prompt". If not specified, the built-in example list will be used.

Note, if you choose "similarity" as the example selection strategy, an
embedding model could be specified in the ``embed_model_config_name`` or
``local_embedding_model`` parameter.

Their differences are listed as follows:

- ``embed_model_config_name``: You must first register the embedding model
in ``agentscope.init`` and specify the model configuration name in this
parameter.
- ``local_embedding_model``: Optionally, you can use a local small embedding
model supported by the ``sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformer`` library.

AgentScope will use a default "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
model if you do not specify the above parameters, which is small enough to
run in CPU.
